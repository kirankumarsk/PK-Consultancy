                        <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;" class="textip">A database management system (DBMS) is system software 
                            for creating and managing databases. A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, protect, read, 
                            update and delete data in a database. The most prevalent type of data management platform, the DBMS essentially
                             serves as an interface between databases and users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently 
                             organized and remains easily accessible.
                            <br>&emsp;The DBMS manages the data; the database engine allows data to be accessed, locked and modified; and the database 
                            schema defines the database's logical structure. These three foundational elements help provide concurrency, 
                            security, data integrity and uniform data administration procedures. The DBMS supports many typical database 
                            administration tasks, including change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, and backup and 
                            recovery. Most database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks and restarts as well as 
                            logging and auditing of activity in databases and the applications that access them.
                           <br>&emsp;The DBMS provides a centralized view of data that can be accessed by multiple users from multiple locations in a 
                            controlled manner. A DBMS can limit what data end users see and how they view the data, providing many views of a 
                            single database schema. End users and software programs are free from having to understand where the data is 
                            physically located or on what type of storage medium it resides because the DBMS handles all requests.
                            The DBMS can offer both logical and physical data independence to protect users and applications from having 
                            to know where data is stored or from being concerned about changes to the physical structure of data. 
                            <br>&emsp;So long as programs use the application programming interface (API) for the database that the DBMS provides, 
                            developers won't have to modify programs just because changes have been made to the database.

                                    <br>List of Projects and its description is given below:-</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Online Shopping Portal</span><br>&emsp;This project is a web based shopping system for an 
                                        existing shop.The project objective is to deliver the online shopping application intoandroid platform. 
                                        Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods orservices from a seller in real-time, 
                                        without an intermediary service, overthe Internet. It is a form of electronic commerce. This project is an 
                                        attemptto provide the advantages of online shopping to customers of a real shop.It helps buying the products 
                                        in the shop anywhere through internet byusing an android device. </li>
                                    <li><span>Superstore Management System</span><br>&emsp;Super store is an Indian retail store that operates as a chain of hypermarkets.
                                        It is one of the oldest and largest hypermarket chain of India, housing about 150+ stores over 60 cities and towns of the country. It has wide range of categories such as Groceries, Clothing & Fashion, Furniture, Electronics,Office Supplies, Cosmetics, Kitchen & Dining utilities and many more</li>
                                    <li><span>Inventory Management System</span><br>&emsp;This project is aimed at developing a desktop based application named Inventory Management System for managing the inventory system of any organization. The Inventory Management System (IMS) refers to the system and processes to manage the stock of organization with the involvement of Technology system. This system can be used to store the details of the inventory, stock maintenance, update the inventory based on the sales details, generate sales and inventory report daily or weekly based.</li>
                                    <li><span>Ecommerce Management System</span><br>&emsp;In this modern era of online shopping no seller wants to be left behind, moreover due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth.
                                        Therefore, as an engineer our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller. Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence in this project we are planning to design a database where small clothing sellers can sell their product online.</li>
